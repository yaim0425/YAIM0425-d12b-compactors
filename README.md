# YAIM0425 d12b – Compactors 🗜️📦

## 📦 Description

**YAIM0425 d12b – Compactors** introduces special machines that allow you to **compress items into compact forms** and later **decompress them back** to their original state.

This MOD is designed to make **storage, transport, and logistics** more efficient, especially when dealing with large quantities of items.

## ⚙️ How it works (Player view)

* Adds **compactor entities** for item compression
* Items can be:

  * **Decompressed** back into normal items when needed
* Ideal for:

  * Saving storage space

  * Long-distance logistics solutions

Operation is straightforward: insert items to compact them, or feed compacted items to restore them.
